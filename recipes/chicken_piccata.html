    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Chicken piccata is super quick and easy to make with pounded
        chicken breasts and a simple pan sauce made with capers, 
        butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour for dredging</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of
            heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken
            breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper;
             dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through,
             about 5 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds.
             Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
             Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Step 5: Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes.
             Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
